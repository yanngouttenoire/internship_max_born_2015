The goal of this main simulation is to test the influence of nFieldBirth and nVZPrimPerpBirth with a linear field and an hydrogen potential.
We see that when nFieldBirth or nVZPrimPerpBirth increase then the spectrum becomes finer and shows more details.
But it is actually impossible to see the difference between the influence of the 2 parameters.
