# Motivated interest

The goal of this main simulation is to test the influence of nVYPerpBirth with a weak ellipticity (ellipticity=0.1) and an hydrogen potential.

# Results

  - We see thath spectra are really different than those with nVYPerpBirth=0:  
    - it appears complex structure with a lot of peaks,  
    - besides the maximum asymptotic energy hardly reaches 2 au.
